This is the user content folder for the deepfake. If you aren't very smart, then ignore everything
except this folder as it's all that's really important.

This is where you store your original video and image. This is also where the finished product will
be saved to.

The original image MUST BE A PNG FILE. It cannot be any other format. It must also be named
"original-image.png". If not then the deepfake generator will throw an error.

The original video MUST BE A MP4 FILE. Just like with the image, it can't be anything else.
It must be named "original-video.mp4" otherwise... well, errors.

When the deepfake completes, the finished video will be saved to here with the name "result.mp4".
