# One Click Deepfake
The easy way to create a quick deepfake.

The main goal of this is to make using the First Order Motion Model to create a basic deepfake much easier.
Pretty much everything is written in Python and can be easily modified if you wish.

This works for both Windows and Linux with about the same level of complexity.

## How to use (Windows)
Using One Click Deepfake is very easy!

### 1. Download the source code and the model.
   You can either use git or your browser.
   `git clone https://github.com/Kiddo9000/One-Click-Deepfake.git`
   If you download using your browser, remember to unzip it!

### 2. Run the deepfake menu.
   Run the "Deepfake.bat" file located in the "Scripts" folder. You will be presented with a menu with several options.
   For most people, the "Install Everything" option will work just fine. This will install Python 3 (if it is not detected), Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (Required for some of the Python dependencies), all the dependencies, and download the deepfake model.
   If you want to install Python and the C++ Build Tools manually, then you can run the setup programs located in the "tools" folder.

### 3. Prepare the deepfake files.
   

   
## Third Party Code/Credits
This project would have not been possible without the awesome people who made the First Order Motion Model library possible! (And chose to make it open source, too!)  
This project also relies on code from the awesome people who made the dependencies that this uses.
