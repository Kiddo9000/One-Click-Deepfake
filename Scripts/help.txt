General Help:

    Some dependencies failed to install due to C++ build tool errors
        Some of the dependencies need the Microsoft C++ Build Tools 14.0 or better
        to be installed so they can compile critcal tools. Run the Install Everything
        option and make sure to install the C++ Build Tools when prompted. Note:
        You may need to restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

    What mode do I use? CPU or CUDA?
        This depends on your system's hardware. Mainly your GPU. If you have a NVIDIA
        GPU with CUDA avaliable on it, then you can use the CUDA acceleration to process
        your Deepfake faster. If you do not have a CUDA capible GPU or non-NVIDIA GPU,
        then you have to use the CPU mode.

    Error: No NVIDIA GPU detected in your system.
        This error may pop up from using the wrong mode. If you do not have an NVIDIA GPU
        in your PC, then you cannot use CUDA. If you do have one, then it might not be
        CUDA capible. Check online to make sure your specific GPU is CUDA ready.

    I want to use CPU mode instead of CUDA or other way round.
        You will need to uninstall Torch first. This can be done through the menu. Once you
        have done that, you can reinstall using the mode you would like to use.
